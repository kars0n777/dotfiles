# NvChad Configuration

All of the config I have actually done is made in ~/.config/nvim/lua/custom

There is very little customization outside of the default [NvChad](https://nvchad.com) configuration

# IMPORTANT

Please remove #custom from ~/.config/nvim/.gitignore or else when you update NvChad my customization will be removed
