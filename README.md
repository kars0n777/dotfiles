# My Dotfiles
### These aren't for wide use, but just something take and modify.

- These are my dotfiles, I can promise you most of them are taken from someone elses github repo and edited to some extent

- My vim bashrc zshrc and other configs are based off of [distrotube's gitlab](https://gitlab.com/dwt1)
- My lf and some other configs are based off of [brodie robertson's github](https://github.com/BrodieRobertson)

If there are any issues with my dotfiles or something you think I could add let me know!
